Overview
The DoubleAuction smart contract provides an auction marketplace where buyers and sellers can place bids. The contract matches bids based on predefined rules and facilitates payment transactions between parties.

This contract is part of a decentralized application (DApp) that has three roles:

Sellers: Place sell bids for goods or services.
Buyers: Place buy bids.
Market Operator: Executes the auction and finalizes transactions.
Features
Allows sellers to place sell bids and buyers to place buy bids.
Executes double auctions based on matching bid logic.
Manages auction history and user roles (seller, buyer, market operator).
Secure transaction handling with Ethereumâ€™s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).
